diagis 0.2.2 (Release date: 2021-11-30)
==============
* All functions now check that weights are non-negative and numeric, and that 
  at least one weight is positive.

diagis 0.2.1 (Release date: 2021-11-16)
==============
* Fixed some URLs.

diagis 0.2.0 (Release date: 2021-11-15)
==============

* Added a function weighted_quantile for weighted quantiles.
* Minor tweaks in documentation, added explanation of weighted quantiles.

diagis 0.1.5 (Release date: 2020-05-24)
==============

* Fixed missing value handling.

diagis 0.1.4 (Release date: 2020-05-24)
==============

* Return NA for all NA samples instead of occasional zero (e.g. weighted_se).

diagis 0.1.3-1 (Release date: 2018-01-25)
==============

* Proper checking of na.rm argument following updated CRAN checks.

diagis 0.1.3 (Release date: 2017-07-27)
==============

* Fixed a bug where some of the methods gave error due to R's automatic dimension drop.

diagis 0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-05-22)
==============

* Proper handling of cases of running weighted summaries with zero weights 
  at the start. 
* Now supports mcmc objects from coda, and ts objects from stats.
* Switched the default behaviour of weighted variance, now computes the moment
  estimator by default, as the "unbiased" method is not truly unbiased in case 
  of self-normalized importance sampling.
