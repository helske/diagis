diagis 0.1.3 (Release date: 2017-07-27)
==============

* Fixed a bug where some of the methods gave error due to R's automatic dimension drop.

diagis 0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-05-22)
==============

* Proper handling of cases of running weighted summaries with zero weights 
  at the start. 
* Now supports mcmc objects from coda, and ts objects from stats.
* Switched the default behaviour of weighted variance, now computes the moment
  estimator by default, as the "unbiased" method is not truly unbiased in case 
  of self-normalized importance sampling.
